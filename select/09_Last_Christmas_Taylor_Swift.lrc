[00:17.42] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[00:20.82] But the very next day you gave it away
[00:25.63] This year, to save me from tears
[00:29.58] I'll give it to someone special
[00:45.08] 
[00:34.23] Once bitten and twice shy
[00:38.20] I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
[00:42.62] Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
[00:46.13] Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
[01:09.13] 
[00:51.08] "Merry Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
[00:54.47] With a note saying "I love you," I meant it
[00:58.55] Now I know what a fool I've been
[01:02.19] But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
[01:28.19] 
[01:06.73] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[01:10.87] But the very next day you gave it away
[01:15.16] This year, to save me from tears
[01:19.25] I'll give it to someone special
[01:34.75] 
[01:23.43] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[01:27.15] But the very next day you gave it away
[01:31.44] This year, to save me from tears
[01:35.50] I'll give it to someone special
[01:51.00] 
[01:40.36] A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
[01:44.77] I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
[01:48.61] My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
[01:52.58] Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
[02:11.58] 
[01:55.55] A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
[02:00.41] A girl under cover, but you tore her apart
[02:04.53] Maybe this year, maybe this year
[02:09.01] I'll give it to someone special
[02:24.51] 
[02:13.17] 'Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[02:16.89] But the very next day you gave it away
[02:21.49] This year, to save me from tears
[02:25.09] I'll give it to someone special
[02:40.59] 
[02:29.62] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[02:33.53] But the very next day you gave it away
[02:38.48] This year, to save me from tears
[02:41.96] I'll give it to someone special
[02:57.46] 
[02:46.34] And last Christmas
[02:54.60] And this year
[02:58.19] Won't be anything like, anything like-
[03:17.19] 
[03:02.72] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[03:06.38] But the very next day you gave it away
[03:11.05] This year, to save me from tears
[03:14.92] I'll give it to someone special
