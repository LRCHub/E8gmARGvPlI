Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone
Special

I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away

This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Happy Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying
'I love you,' I meant it
Now I know
What a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone
Special

Oh, oh my baby
Crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were
Someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder
To cry on
A face on a lover
With a fire in his heart
A man undercover
But you tore him apart
Ooh hoo
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day
You gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone

Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone
