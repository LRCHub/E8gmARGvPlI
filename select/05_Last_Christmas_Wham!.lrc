[00:05.63] Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh
[00:12.06] Ah-ah
[00:14.56] 
[00:17.70] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[00:21.73] But the very next day, you gave it away
[00:26.73] This year, to save me from tears
[00:30.76] I'll give it to someone special
[00:46.26] 
[00:35.13] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[00:40.06] But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
[00:44.21] This year, to save me from tears
[00:49.10] I'll give it to someone special (special)
[01:09.60] 
[01:11.65] Once bitten and twice shy
[01:16.08] I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
[01:21.30] Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
[01:25.25] Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
[01:48.25] 
[01:30.04] "Merry Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
[01:34.65] With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
[01:38.95] Now I know what a fool I've been
[01:42.35] But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
[02:08.35] 
[01:47.98] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[01:51.34] But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
[01:55.52] This year, to save me from tears
[01:59.97] I'll give it to someone special (special)
[02:20.47] 
[02:05.22] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[02:09.32] But the very next day, you gave it away
[02:13.34] This year, to save me from tears
[02:18.66] I'll give it to someone special (special)
[02:39.16] 
[02:41.47] A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
[02:46.39] I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
[02:50.68] My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
[02:54.72] Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
[03:13.72] 
[02:59.23] A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
[03:03.49] A man undercover, but you tore me apart
[03:10.18] Ooh-hoo
[03:11.90] Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
[03:38.90] 
[03:17.51] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
[03:20.97] But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
[03:25.53] This year, to save me from tears
[03:30.06] I'll give it to someone special (special)
[03:50.56] 
[03:34.92] Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
[03:39.35] But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
[03:43.85] This year, to save me from tears
[03:48.48] I'll give it to someone special (special)
[04:08.98] 
[03:52.68] A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
[03:57.37] A man undercover, but you tore him apart
[04:01.77] Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone
[04:06.86] I'll give it to someone special (special!)
[04:11.63] So long!
